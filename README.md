## Bypass low-level censorship and conserve your privacy and rights!.

### Introduction & Use-Cases

The main use-case scenario is if you're a privacy-conscious individual who wish for their privacy to be respected by others as much as they can. Using this service can ease in the use of accessing other services through privacy-respecting WWW Proxies by 'ethically and legally exploiting' their APIs.

This project aims to end Local Network internet censorship at a high level. This repository is designed to be easily reproducable and at a low or non-existent price as it is a 'static website' but also uses no javascript.

I DO NOT CONDONE THIS but another example of where this program is applicable is in a school, workplace or hotel where local network blocking is used either by using 'Trick Domain Name Server(s) or TDNS for short' or any other means. Again, I RECOMMEND AGAINST USING MY PROJECT FOR THIS, YOUR FAULT IF YOU GET FIRED.

Also... No Javascript! https://www.infoworld.com/article/2641586/javascript-considered-harmful-.html
